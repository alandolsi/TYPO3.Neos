    <title>TYPO3 Phoenix</title>

    <para>Back in 2005 it was decided to start with a new TYPO3 version that
    should eventually replace the current major version 4. In the long and
    twisted process that followed we had to write a new framework first
    (FLOW3), struggle with the release schedule of PHP6, fight tools not
    supporting PHP namespaces, and come up with good ideas for that
    next-generation CMS we were about to build.</para>

    <para>Now we actually have first releases of TYPO3 Phoenix, as it was
    codenamed back then â€“ and they are probably not what you expected. They
    are sprint releases, following a iteration in our Scrum-based project
    management. As such they are complete releases, doing everything they are
    supposed to do, <emphasis>according to the goals of their
    sprint</emphasis>.</para>

    <para>They are not, releases of TYPO3 5.0, though - as you would probably
    laugh about the feaure set, then...</para>

    <title>System Overview</title>

    <para>TYPO3 Phoenix is made up of packages and based on the FLOW3
    framework. Most of the packages are part of the FLOW3 base system, TYPO3
    Phoenix consists of a few additional packages, like TYPO3, TypoScript,
    TYPO3CR in which the actual CMS functionality is contained. The templates,
    graphics and content of the demo site are in another package.<figure>
