Creating Content in Wireframe Mode
==================================

In Neos users can start adding content immediately after a site has been created, even
if no design has been implemented yet. This is possible with the `wireframe mode` that
can be switched on when in the Content View.

It allows the creation of arbitrary content collections and content elements, rendering
everything in a stripped down representation.
